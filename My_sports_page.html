					     <p>I started hockey in the beginning 2013. In our city opened an ice rink. And my mother brought me walking skates from Slovenia. I didn't  even know how to hold balance on the ice. But when I  came to the hockey team, my experience began with the same high speed as a bruises on different parts of the body.
						 We bought whole equipment for hockey, some of it wasn't new. But I was happy to had it, especially hamlet. It was yellow color, and the first owner of it  was from the Pittsburgh Penguin's  team.This helmet has become my talisman!

		    			 <p>In the Crimean hockey I was 3 year and 6 months. There was a time of bright sports life and a heavy training process. Sometimes we had 2 training per day in ice and one in grass.
						 I traveled a lot with my team. I was on different hockey tournaments. Several times we were on Sochi l in the large ice arena, also in St. Petersburg and in Adler.

					     <p> And I trained under the excellent coaches, but I played almost the whole year in a very weak team.My mum drives me 4 times a week to Ljubljana. It was 250 km in two ways. So,  during the year we'd got more then 60.000 km.
                            I traveled all the neighboring countries. He played in Croatia, Hungary, Austria and, of course, on the all ice fields of Slovenia.
